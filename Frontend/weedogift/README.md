This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 6.0.0.

## Lauch the Test

Run `npm install` to download all the dependencies. (in calculator-server too)
Use `npm start` to run concurrently the front server and the back server

## Comments

I modified `calculator-server\app.js` to enable CORS (problem with httpClient in Angular).
First experience in Angular and Typescript so I may not have all best-practices.
